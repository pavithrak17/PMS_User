## About
---
The Placement Management System is built using Java and Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The backend handles server-side logic, database interactions, and RESTful API endpoints, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

---

## Technologies Used
---
- **Java**: Programming language used for backend development.  
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend application.  
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction and ORM.  
- **MySQL**: Relational database for data storage.  
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool.  
---

## Frontend Technologies
---
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the frontend.
- **CSS**: Styling the frontend to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.

---

## Installation

To set up both the backend and frontend on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Backend Installation:
1. **Clone the backend repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavithrak17/placement-management-system-backend.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the backend project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd placement-management-system-backend
   ```
3. **Configure the database** (MySQL):
   - Create a new MySQL database for the application.
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your database connection details:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```
4. **Build and run the backend application:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Frontend Installation:
1. **Clone the frontend repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavithrak17/placement-management-system-frontend.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the frontend project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd placement-management-system-frontend
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the frontend application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will start the frontend application, which will be available on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend applications are running, you can interact with the API using the frontend interface at `http://localhost:3000`. The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

Here are some key API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                     | Description                     |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/users`                 | Retrieve all users              |
| GET    | `/api/users/{id}`            | Retrieve a user by ID           |
| POST   | `/api/users`                 | Create a new user               |
| PUT    | `/api/users/{id}`            | Update a user by ID             |
| DELETE | `/api/users/{id}`            | Delete a user by ID             |

## User Module
---
The **User Module** is a key component of the Placement Management System, responsible for managing user-related functionalities. This module allows for user registration, authentication, and management of user profiles.

### Key Features:
- **User Registration**: New users can create accounts by providing necessary details, which are securely stored in the database.
- **User Authentication**: Registered users can log in using their credentials, enabling access to the system.
- **User Management**: Administrators can view, update, and delete user profiles as needed, ensuring effective management of user data.
