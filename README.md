## About
---
The Placement Management System is built using Java and Spring Boot. This backend application handles all server-side logic, database interactions, and RESTful API endpoints to support the functionalities of the Placement Management System.
---

## Technologies Used
---
- **Java**: Programming language used for backend development.  
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend application.  
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction and ORM.  
- **MySQL**: Relational database for data storage.  
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool.  
---

## Installation

To set up the backend on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavithrak17/placement-management-system-backend.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd placement-management-system-backend
   ```

3. **Configure the database:**
   - Create a new MySQL database for the application.
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your database connection details:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```

4. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Usage

Once the backend application is running, it will listen on the default port `8080`. You can interact with the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.

## API Endpoints

Here are some key API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                     | Description                     |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/users`                 | Retrieve all users              |
| GET    | `/api/users/{id}`            | Retrieve a user by ID           |
| POST   | `/api/users`                 | Create a new user               |
| PUT    | `/api/users/{id}`            | Update a user by ID             |
| DELETE | `/api/users/{id}`            | Delete a user by ID             |

## User Module
---
The **User Module** is a key component of the Placement Management System, responsible for managing user-related functionalities. This module allows for user registration, authentication, and management of user profiles. 

### Key Features:
- **User Registration**: New users can create accounts by providing necessary details, which are securely stored in the database.
- **User Authentication**: Registered users can log in using their credentials, enabling access to the system.
- **User Management**: Administrators can view, update, and delete user profiles as needed, ensuring effective management of user data.
